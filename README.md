## NOTE
    1. The script is designed for a display resolution of 1920x1080 but is written dynamically to adapt to different screen sizes. You can adjust the coordinate ratios based on your screen resolution.
    2. Please review the code carefully before executing it. Since the script performs rapid clicks, it could accidentally click on unintended areas and cause issues.
    3. Comments have been added throughout the code to help with customization.
    4. The script assumes valid agent keys. If an invalid key is provided, it will not perform any action. Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs.
    5. Ensure your system can handle rapid clicks without lag. If you experience issues, consider adding slight delays between actions.
    6. Test the script in a safe environment before using it in a live game to ensure it behaves as expected.
    7. Use this script responsibly. Automating actions in games may violate their terms of service, so proceed at your own risk.
    8. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to raise a PR.
